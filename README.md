# Obasa_Ifekitan_DandD_Bugs

Troubleshooting and fixing bugs

## Description

Use the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop) and fix the bugs that were
discovered in class. This is a research assignment - solve the problems outlined in
the brief.
Create new branches (named appropriately) and update the functionality to improve
the game UX.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Uses Javascript's latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [parentNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentNode), [removeChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild), [return](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) for reference).
Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including Babel for transcription (or an NPM script).

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
